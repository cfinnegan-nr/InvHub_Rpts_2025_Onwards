As a Python developer I want to extend the code in the attached Python .py file so that it does not just generate an image file 
but is also adds the EPIC Summary data from the attached spreadsheet into an EXCEL spreadsheet. The layout of the data in the 
XL file should be same as the in the image file. However, in both the image file the data should be sorted by the 'Status' column 
and totals should be added at the end of all columns apart from 'Epic', 'pass Rate' and 'Status'. Can you amend the python code 
and provide it in a new .py file?
